# Figma-to-Responsive-Webpage

###  Day 2 – 29th July 2025

A fully responsive webpage built with **HTML** and **CSS**, based on a Figma design. The layout adapts seamlessly to **mobile**, **tablet**, and **desktop** screen sizes for an optimal user experience.

##  Technologies Used

- HTML5  
- CSS3  
- Figma (as design reference)  
- Visual Studio Code

##  What I Learned

- Faced challenges using the `calc()` function to calculate card widths dynamically.
- Learned to avoid image stretching using the `object-fit` property:
  ```css
  object-fit: cover;
````

* Understood how to use **child selectors** to apply styles only to children of a parent selector:

  ```css
  .blog-card-image > img {
    object-fit: cover;
  }
  ```
* Learned how to center a `div` horizontally using:

  ```css
  margin-left: auto;
  margin-right: auto;
  ```
